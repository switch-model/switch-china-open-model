# SWITCH-China Open Model

This repository has the database and inputs for the SWITCH model China study (SWITCH-China).

## Overview

The "inputs" files serve as an example of inputs that can be used to run SWITCH model for China study. The model was updated as much as 2020 base year, and it could serve as a foundation for our collective continuous efforts. You can update corresponding tables, e.g. technologies, capital costs, carbon prices, technology plans, fuel costs, and other inputs to meet your modeling needs. 

## Acknowledgements

The database benefits from many people's work and contributions. This work is based on the SWITCH model created by Matthias Fripp. Gang He leads the efforts to aggregate the data, run the model, and write corresponding papers. Anne-Perrine Avrin contributed to the nuclear module and data processing. James Nelson, Josiah Johnston, Ana Mileva contributed an earlier version of SWITCH-China. Josiah Johnston facilitates greatly on the data management and new capabilities. Jianwei Tian developed an Excel-based 2020 China Power model which is a good resource for SWITCH-China. Bo Li and Patricia Hidalgo-Gonzalez contributed the EV modeling capability. Liqun Peng and Desmond Zhong contributed efforts to modeling storage and hydrogen. Qian Luo, Haozhe Yang, and collaborators have converted SWITCH-China to Gridpath version. Daniel M. Kammen is the director of RAEL at UC Berkeley, who envisions, supervises, and supports the SWITCH umbrella efforts. Jiang Lin of LBL advises and supports the low-cost renewables work. Denise Mauzerall advises and supports the storage strategy work. Model deployment, data collection and updates have benefited from Wenjia Cai, Yu Chen, Yuang Chen, Shiyu Huang, Jingxuan Hui, Haoran Li, Xu Liu, Hongyou Lu, Xiao Su, Yang Wang, Zheng Wang, Kate Yu, Shuyu Yang, Jiahai Yuan, Wenhua Zhang, Hongyang Zou, and many others.
