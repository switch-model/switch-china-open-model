# SWITCH-China Open Model

This repository has the database and inputs for the SWITCH model China study (SWITCH-China).

## Overview

The "inputs" files serve as an example of inputs that can be used to run SWITCH model for China study. The model was updated as much as 2020 base year, and it could serve as a fundation for our collective continous efforts. You can update corresponding tables, e.g. technologies, capital costs, carbon prices, technology plans, fuel costs, and other inputs to meet your modeling needs. 

## Acknowledgements

The database beneifts from many people's work and contribution. This work is based on the SWITCH model created by Matthias Fripp. Gang He leads the efforts to aggregate the data, run the model, and write the papers. Anne-Perrine Avrin contributed to the nuclear module, data processing, and paper writing. James Nelson, Josiah Johnston, Ana Mileva contributed an earlier version of SWITCH-China. Josiah Johnston facilitates greatly the data management and new capabilities. Jianwei Tian developed an Excel-based 2020 China Power model which is a good resource of SWITCH-China. Bo Li and Patricia Hidalgo-Gonzalez contributed the EV modeling capability. Liqun Peng and Desmond Zhong contributed efforts on modeling storage and hydrogen. Daniel M. Kammen is the director of RAEL at UC Berkeley, who envisions, supervises, and supports the efforts. Jiang Lin of LBL advises and supports the low costs renewables work. Data collections have benefited from Wenjia Cai, Yu Chen, Shiyu Huang, Jingxuan Hui, Haoran Li, Xu Liu, Hongyou Lu, Xiao Su, Kate Yu, Shuyu Yang, Jiahai Yuan, Wenhua Zhang, Hongyang Zou, and many others.
